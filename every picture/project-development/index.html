    <h1>Every Picture Project Development</h1>

    <p>I created new design comps to feel like a concert poster or festival lineup for the concerts I attended in 2023. I wanted to capture the energy of live music with bold typography, a dynamic layout, and fun intentional color choices. The images are arranged in a roll , mimicking a setlist or lineup board, with hover and click effects to help with user engagement.With this an overlay will open to give a description and show a video of the artist performing. This design is all about celebrating the artists, music, memories, and experience of being in the crowd.</p>
