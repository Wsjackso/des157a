            <p>
                This photo is a selfie of Natalie in her glasses. The image is about her seeing how her glasses look on her. We’ve all been there before taking a quick pic 
                to see how we look with added elements like a hat or glasses. I think the most interesting part of the photo is her facial expression, which is really relaxed. 
                It shows that she wanted the focus to be on the glasses and not just a pic for posting on social media.The most obvious aspects of this image are Natalie and her glasses, which 
                take up the majority of the photo. One thing that adds a mysterious element to the image is the background. It’s Natalie’s room, and though you can't see much, you can catch her vibe 
                from her posters, which are really cool.I think it’s already a really good concept, and I don’t have many notes or ideas. Off the top of my head, I think it would be really cool to add 
                other pop-up elements like hats or a mustache to go with different glasses to add more creativity, but the concept is already solid.

            <p>Visual literacy is basically your ability to understand what visual media means to you.Making observations and understanding your thoughts clearly 
                to articulate what impression the media is leaving on you. That means analyzing and questioning the choices of the artist to fully understand your 
                own feelings about the media. I think the article does a great job of explaining how to use visual thinking to better understand the everyday media 
                we interact with. Visual literacy skills are often only used in settings like museums, historical buildings, and classrooms, but we interact with visual
                media every day. Understanding how to use visual thinking in everyday media like TikTok or Instagram is important for fostering collaboration, communication, 
                and understanding in today’s society.</p>

             <p>The Andy Warhol site uses bold colors, playful typography, and interactive elements to immerse users in visual thinking. It does a great job of showing how 
                images and interaction shape perception. The pop art makes it engaging, but the navigation can be a bit confusing. Understanding how design choices affect 
                interpretation helps develop visual literacy, making it useful beyond museums.</p>

            <h1> Post 2 - Overlays Design Pattern Research</h1>
            <time datetime="2025-1-30">Jaunary 30,2025</time>
            <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Link to Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a>

            <p>The article “Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/ Dialog Windows” covers how to make overlays more effective and user-friendly designs. One thing I 
                learned is how important it is to give users clear ways to exit the overlay like a close button, clicking outside the overlay, or pressing the Escape 
                key. If people feel trapped in a overlay, it’s a bad user experience. Another interesting point was about focus. Overlays should dim the background 
                and keep the focus on the modal window to avoid distractions, especially for accessibility. I also liked the idea of using actionable buttons with clear labels, 
                like “Confirm” or “Cancel,” instead of something like “OK.”Overall, I think this article had good tips and it helped me understand how good overlay design keeps 
                the user in control while interacting with web designs.</p>

            <time datetime="2025-1-25">Jaunary 25,2025</time>
            <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Link to Best practies for form design</a>

            <p>The article “Best Practices for Form Design” provides an overview of how to create more effective, user-friendly forms. Going 
                through the 20 practices gave me a much better understanding of what makes good form design. As a designer, every decision matters 
                when creating an experience for others. For example, using principles like “multiple steps” helps reduce the user’s cognitive load by 
                breaking up the process and showing how many steps are left. This approach allows users to focus on the current step without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

             <p>Another point I found interesting was about placeholder text. It can hurt usability because once users start typing, they might forget what was written 
                and have to delete their input to see it again. To avoid this, adding a description below the input field is a better user friendly design choice. Overall, 
                this article was a cool guide for improving form design.</p>
               
             <p>
                The website I chose with good user-friendly form design is Hungryroot. Hungryroot offers curated meals that you can order based on personalized recommendations 
                from a quiz. The quiz is engaging and only takes a 15 minutes to complete. By answering a few questions, you get a curated taste profile, which makes the experience 
                feel personalized and fun.
