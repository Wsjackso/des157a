            <p>The article “Best Practices for Form Design” provides an overview of how to create more effective, user-friendly forms. Going 
                through the 20 practices gave me a much better understanding of what makes good form design. As a designer, every decision matters 
                when creating an experience for others. For example, using principles like “multiple steps” helps reduce the user’s cognitive load by 
                breaking up the process and showing how many steps are left. This approach allows users to focus on the current step without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

             <p>Another point I found interesting was about placeholder text. It can hurt usability because once users start typing, they might forget what was written 
                and have to delete their input to see it again. To avoid this, adding a description below the input field is a better user friendly design choice. Overall, 
                this article was a cool guide for improving form design.</p>
               
             <p>
                The website I chose with good user-friendly form design is Hungryroot. Hungryroot offers curated meals that you can order based on personalized recommendations 
                from a quiz. The quiz is engaging and only takes a 15 minutes to complete. By answering a few questions, you get a curated taste profile, which makes the experience 
                feel personalized and fun.
